The global system of interconnected computer networks, known as the Internet, utilizes the TCP/IP protocol suite to facilitate communication among devices and networks.
This "network of networks" encompasses a wide variety of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, spanning from local to global scales and connected via electronic, wireless, and optical technologies.
It hosts an extensive array of information and services, including the World Wide Web's inter-linked documents, email, VoIP, and file sharing protocols.
Internet history traces back to 1960s US government research aimed at creating robust, fault-tolerant computer communication networks.
ARPANET, the main precursor, functioned as a backbone connecting regional academic and military networks during the 1980s.
With the establishment of the National Science Foundation Network and other commercial backbones in the 1980s, global participation in networking technology development surged, leading to the amalgamation of numerous networks.
By the early 1990s, the integration of commercial networks signaled the shift towards the modern Internet, fueling exponential growth as more institutional, personal, and mobile devices connected.
While academia utilized the Internet extensively from the 1980s, its commercialization has since embedded its technologies and services into nearly every facet of contemporary life.
