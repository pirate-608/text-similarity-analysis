Developing software involves applying engineering methods systematically.
The DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) is crucial for avoiding redundant code patterns.
SOLID principles help developers create software that is easy to maintain and extend.
By following these best practices, engineers can build robust and performant applications.
The lifecycle of software development also heavily relies on thorough testing and comprehensive documentation.
