Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software.
A key principle is "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY), which aims to reduce repetition of software patterns.
Another important concept is SOLID, a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
Good software engineering practices lead to reliable and efficient software systems.
Testing and documentation are also integral parts of the software engineering lifecycle.
